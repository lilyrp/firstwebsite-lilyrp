  <h1>A Comprehensive List of Every Role I've Ever Played on Stage</h1>
  <p>For over seven years, I've been an active participant of all theater endeavors. Since COVID was impending early March the spring muscial, Xanadu, was canceled. I've spent the last six months reflecting on my time on stage, a place I severly took for granted. Here is my list of my favorite roles I've ever played, from my most favorite to my least favorite. </p>
